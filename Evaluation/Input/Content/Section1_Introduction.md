Felodipine is a calcium-channel blocker, indicated for angina pectoris and arterial hypertension. It is mostly metabolized by CYP3A4 making it a sensitive probe and victim drug for the investigation of CYP3A4 activity *in vivo*. It is a BCS class II compound. Felodipine shows substantial first pass metabolism resulting in a bioavailability of 15%. 

The model has been developed and evaluated by comparing observed data to simulations of a large number of clinical studies covering a dose range of 1.5 mg to 10 mg after intravenous and oral administrations. Furthermore, it has been evaluated within a CYP3A4 DDI modeling network as a victim drug. 

Model features include:

- metabolism by CYP3A4
- metabolism by an unknown enzyme *via* unspecific hepatic clearance
- a decrease in the permeability between the intracellular and interstitial space (model parameters `P (intracellular->interstitial)` and `P (interstitial->intracellular)`) in intestinal mucosa to optimize quantitatively the extent of gut wall metabolism
