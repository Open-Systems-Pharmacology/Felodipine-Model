The PBPK model for felodipine was developed and verified with clinical pharmacokinetic data.

The model was built and evaluated covering data from studies including in particular

* intravenous (infusions) and oral administrations (solutions, immediate release and extended release tablets).
* a dose range of 1.5 to 10 mg.

The model quantifies metabolism via CYP3A4, and a second unknown hepatic enzyme.

The next sections show:

1. the final model input parameters for the building blocks: [Section 3.1](#31-final-input-parameters).
2. the overall goodness of fit: [Section 3.2](#32-diagnostics-plots).
3. simulated vs. observed concentration-time profiles for the clinical studies used for model building and for model verification: [Section 3.3](#33-concentration-time-profiles).
